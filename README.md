## Introduction

In this project, you'll find a collection of essential machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch using C++. Each algorithm's directory includes a detailed explanation of its workings and a step-by-step implementation. The goal is to help you understand the core concepts by exploring the algorithms' inner mechanics.

## Algorithms

Currently, the repository includes the following algorithms:

- Linear Regression
- Support Vector Machines
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Trees

Stay tuned as we continue to add more algorithms to our collection!

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
